Since the release of UHD v3.15.0.0 and GNU Radio v.3.8.1.0, the Ubuntu 18.04 dependencies to build from source have changed 
and the UHD and GNU Radio documentation has not been updated accordingly (as of 2 May 2020).

The path of least resistance is to undoubtedly to upgrade your PC to Ubuntu 20.04 and install UHD and GNU Radio as follows:
sudo apt install libuhd3.15.0
sudo apt install gnuradio

However, if you would like to build from source and are running Ubuntu 18.04,  you can either use the dependencies in this 
Dockerfile as a reference without using Docker or you could just deploy the container.

HOW TO USE:

Install Docker (assumes a Ubuntu Linux system):
sudo apt install docker.io

Start Docker:
sudo systemctl enable --now docker

Create UHD/GNU Radio Docker image:
1) Navigate to the location where the ettus-docker/ubuntu-uhd-gnuradio/Dockerfile lives.
2) sudo docker build -t ettusresearch/ubuntu-uhd-gnuradio ./
3) Go for a run, bake some sourdough loaves, and have a few drinks-- this step takes a good long while. 

Run the Docker Image (text only):
sudo docker run --rm --interactive --tty ettusresearch/ubuntu-uhd-gnuradio:latest /bin/bash

If you'd like to use gnuradio-companion:
On your PC: xhost local:root
Then run the docker image:
sudo docker run -it --rm -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -e DISPLAY=unix$DISPLAY ettusresearch/ubuntu-uhd-gnuradio:latest /bin/bash

List Docker Images:
sudo docker image list

How to Delete the Docker Image:
sudo docker rmi --force ettusresearch/ubuntu-uhd-gnuradio ettusresearch/ubuntu-uhd-gnuradio

If you don't want to run Docker as sudo, consult this webpage:
